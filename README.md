# Swimming Status Monitor
## Description 

This project monitors swimming activity in real-time by using a custom water detection solution and an ADXL343 accelerometer. Water detection wires determine whether the swimmer's head is submerged, while the ADXL343 estimates swimming strokes and calculates approximate swimming distance. The ESP32 serves as the central microcontroller, providing powerful processing capabilities and built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for communication. At home, a monitoring unit displays all collected data, including swimming type, accumulated time, head position, and estimated swimming distance.
